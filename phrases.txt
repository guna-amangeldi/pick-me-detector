I’m not pretty. Or interesting.
Other girls are more.
You don’t have to worry about me.
I’m fine being invisible.
I don’t belong anywhere except with you.
I don’t fit in with girls.
I don’t like shopping or makeup.
I’m clumsy — it’s kind of my thing.
I’m boring. You wouldn’t like me.
You’re my entire world.
If I have to die, it should be for you.
My life doesn’t matter if you’re gone.
I’ll do whatever you want — just don’t leave.
